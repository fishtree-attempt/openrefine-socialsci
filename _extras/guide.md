## Lesson

This time allotted for the teaching and exercises in lessons one through eight in this episode totals 135 minutes. This does not include time for installing OpenRefine, which could take an extra 10-30 minutes depending on how many different platforms and how many computers need OpenRefine installed.

## Setup

There is a seperate file for the setup instructions for installing OpenRefine ([setup](/setup/)).

## The datasets used

- The only dataset used in this lesson is the 'Moz_SAFI_Survey_Final_results.csv' file which is in the data folder.
- It will need to be downloaded to the local machine before it can be loaded into OpenRefine.
- A general description of the datasets used in the Social Sciences lessons can be found [here](need_link)

## The Lessons

[Introduction](/01-introduction/)

- Explains whatOpenRefine is, what it is used for and where to get help.

[Working with OpenRefine](/02-working-with-openrefine/)

- Covers the creation of an OpenRefine project using the 'Moz_SAFI_Survey_Final_results.csv' file.
- The file has a single header row and is csv.
- Facets and clustering are introduced and there is a discussion on the different clustering algorithms and how they may produce different results.
- Splitting columns is covered as is undo/redo. Failing to undo the column split will not effect anything.

[Filtering and Sorting](/03-filter-sort/)

- Using Include and Exclude from a facet is covered and the difference between Faceting and filtering is explained.
- The various sort options for single or multiple columns is covered.


[Using regular expressions](/04-regex/)

- A very simple example of using a regular expression is given.
This episode is entirely a walkthrough demonstration of how to do it.

[Examining Numbers in OpenRefine](/05-numbers/)

- Explains that everything is a string until you change it.
- Explains how to change the data type and the additional faceting ability it provides.

[Using scripts](/06-scripts/)

- Explains how actions within a project can be copied to an external file and re-applied. The same file is used to re-apply the changes.


[Saving results](/07-saving/)

- Covers the overall format of a project 'file' and how the components can be viewed.
- This may require installing additional software on Windows machine (e.g. 7-zip) as the builin un-zipping facility does not work with tar.gz files.

[Other resources in OpenRefine](/08-resources/)

- Just a list of various OpenRefine resources available on-line (taken from the Ecology lessons)
