## Setup

There is a seperate file for the setiup instructions for installing OpenRefine. [setup](../setup.md)

## The datasets used

The only dataset used in this lesson is the 'Moz_SAFI_Survey_Final_results.csv' file which is in the data folder.

It will need to be downloaded to the local machine before it can be loaded into OpenRefine.

A general description of the datasets used in the Social Sciences lessons can be found [here](link)

## The Lessons

[Introduction](./00-intrtoduction.md)

Explains whatOpenRefine is, what it is used for and where to get help

[Working with OpenRefine](link)

Covers the creation of a OpenRefine project using the 'Moz_SAFI_Survey_Final_results.csv' file. 

The file has a single header row and is csv.

Facets and clustering are introduced and there is a discussion on the different clustering algorithms and how they may produce different results.

Splitting columns is covered as is undo/redo. Failing to undo the column split will not effect anything.

[Filtering and Sorting](link)

Using Include and Exclude from a facet is covered and the difference between Faceting and filtering is explained.

The various sort options for single or multiple columns is covered. 

 
[Using regular expressions](link)

A very simple example of using a regular expression is given. 
This episode is entirely a walkthrough demonstration of how to do it.

[Examining Numbers in OpenRefine](link)

Explains that everything is a string until you change it. 
Explains how to change the data type and the additional faceting ability it provides.
Covers using the scatterplot facet.

[Using scripts](link)

Explains how actions within a project can be copied to an external file and re-applied. The same file is used to re-apply the changes.


[Saving results](link)

Covers the overall format of a project 'file' and how the components can be viewed.
This may require installing additional software on Windows machine (e.g. 7-zip) as the builin un-zipping facility does not work with tar.gz files.
